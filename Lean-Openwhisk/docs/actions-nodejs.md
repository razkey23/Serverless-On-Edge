## Creating and invoking JavaScript actions

The process of creating JavaScript actions is similar to that of [other actions](actions.md#the-basics).
The following sections guide you through creating and invoking a single JavaScript action,
and demonstrate how to bundle multiple JavaScript files and third party dependencies.

1. Create a JavaScript file with the following content. For this example, the file name is `hello.js`.

  ```javascript
  function main() {
      return { msg: 'Hello world' };
  }
  ```

  The JavaScript file might contain additional functions.
  However, by convention, a function called `main` must exist to provide the entry point for the action.

2. Create an action from the following JavaScript function. For this example, the action is called `hello`.

  ```
  wsk action create hello hello.js
  ok: created action hello
  ```

  The CLI automatically infers the type of the action by using the source file extension.
  For `.js` source files, the action runs by using a Node.js runtime. You may specify
  the Node.js runtime to use by explicitly specifying the parameter `--kind nodejs:10`, `--kind nodejs:8`, or `--kind nodejs:6`


## Creating asynchronous actions

JavaScript functions that run asynchronously may need to return the activation result after the `main` function has returned. You can accomplish this by returning a Promise in your action.

1. Save the following content in a file called `asyncAction.js`.

  ```javascript
  function main(args) {
       return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
         setTimeout(function() {
           resolve({ done: true });
         }, 2000);
      })
   }
  ```

  Notice that the `main` function returns a Promise, which indicates that the activation hasn't completed yet, but is expected to in the future.

  The `setTimeout()` JavaScript function in this case waits for two seconds before calling the callback function.  This represents the asynchronous code and goes inside the Promise's callback function.

  The Promise's callback takes two arguments, resolve and reject, which are both functions.  The call to `resolve()` fulfills the Promise and indicates that the activation has completed normally.

  A call to `reject()` can be used to reject the Promise and signal that the activation has completed abnormally.

2. Run the following commands to create the action and invoke it:

  ```
  wsk action create asyncAction asyncAction.js
  ```
  ```
  wsk action invoke --result asyncAction
  ```
  ```json
  {
      "done": true
  }
  ```

  Notice that you performed a blocking invocation of an asynchronous action.

3. Fetch the activation log to see how long the activation took to complete:

  ```
  wsk activation list --limit 1 asyncAction
  ```
  ```
  activations
  b066ca51e68c4d3382df2d8033265db0             asyncAction
  ```


  ```
  wsk activation get b066ca51e68c4d3382df2d8033265db0
  ```
 ```json
  {
      "start": 1455881628103,
      "end":   1455881648126,
      ...
  }
  ```

  Comparing the `start` and `end` time stamps in the activation record, you can see that this activation took slightly over two seconds to complete.

## Using actions to call an external API

The examples so far have been self-contained JavaScript functions. You can also create an action that calls an external API.

This example invokes a Yahoo Weather service to get the current conditions at a specific location.

1. Save the following content in a file called `weather.js`.

  ```javascript
  var request = require('request');

  function main(params) {
      var location = params.location || 'Vermont';
      var url = 'https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select item.condition from weather.forecast where woeid in (select woeid from geo.places(1) where text="' + location + '")&format=json';

      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
          request.get(url, function(error, response, body) {
              if (error) {
                  reject(error);
              }
              else {
                  var condition = JSON.parse(body).query.results.channel.item.condition;
                  var text = condition.text;
                  var temperature = condition.temp;
                  var output = 'It is ' + temperature + ' degrees in ' + location + ' and ' + text;
                  resolve({msg: output});
              }
          });
      });
  }
  ```

  Note that the action in the example uses the JavaScript `request` library to make an HTTP request to the Yahoo Weather API, and extracts fields from the JSON result.
  See the Javascript [reference](#reference) for the Node.js packages available in the runtime environment.

  This example also shows the need for asynchronous actions. The action returns a Promise to indicate that the result of this action is not available yet when the function returns. Instead, the result is available in the `request` callback after the HTTP call completes, and is passed as an argument to the `resolve()` function.

2. Create an action from the `weather.js` file:

  ```
  wsk action create weather weather.js
  ```

3. Use the following command to run the action, and observe the output:
  ```
  wsk action invoke --result weather --param location "Brooklyn, NY"
  ```

  Using the `--result` flag means that the value returned from the action is shown as output on the command-line:

  ```json
  {
      "msg": "It is 28 degrees in Brooklyn, NY and Cloudy"
  }
  ```

This example also passed a parameter to the action by using the `--param` flag and a value that can be changed each time the action is invoked. Find out more about parameters in the [Working with parameters](./parameters.md) section.

## Packaging an action as a Node.js module

As an alternative to writing all your action code in a single JavaScript source file, you can write an action as a `npm` package. Consider as an example a directory with the following files:

First, `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-action",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies" : {
    "left-pad" : "1.1.3"
  }
}
```

Then, `index.js`:

```javascript
function myAction(args) {
    const leftPad = require("left-pad")
    const lines = args.lines || [];
    return { padded: lines.map(l => leftPad(l, 30, ".")) }
}

exports.main = myAction;
```

Note that the action is exposed through `exports.main`; the action handler itself can have any name, as long as it conforms to the usual signature of accepting an object and returning an object (or a `Promise` of an object). Per Node.js convention, you must either name this file `index.js` or specify the file name you prefer as the `main` property in package.json.

To create an OpenWhisk action from this package:

1. Install first all dependencies locally

  ```
  $ npm install
  ```

2. Create a `.zip` archive containing all files (including all dependencies):

  ```
  $ zip -r action.zip *
  ```

  > Please note: Using the Windows Explorer action for creating the zip file will result in an incorrect structure. OpenWhisk zip actions must have `package.json` at the root of the zip, while Windows Explorer will put it inside a nested folder. The safest option is to use the command line `zip` command as shown above.

3. Create the action:

  ```
  wsk action create packageAction --kind nodejs:10 action.zip
  ```

  When creating an action from a `.zip` archive with the CLI tool, you must explicitly provide a value for the `--kind` flag by using `nodejs:10`, `nodejs:8` or `nodejs:6`.

4. You can invoke the action like any other:

  ```
  wsk action invoke --result packageAction --param lines "[\"and now\", \"for something completely\", \"different\" ]"
  ```
  ```json
  {
      "padded": [
          ".......................and now",
          "......for something completely",
          ".....................different"
      ]
  }
  ```

Finally, note that while most `npm` packages install JavaScript sources on `npm install`, some also install and compile binary artifacts. The archive file upload currently does not support binary dependencies but rather only JavaScript dependencies. Action invocations may fail if the archive includes binary dependencies.

### Package an action as a single bundle

It is convenient to only include the minimal code into a single `.js` file that includes dependencies. This approach allows for faster deployments, and in some circumstances where packaging the action as a zip might be too large because it includes unnecessary files.

You can use a JavaScript module bundler such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). When webpack processes your code, it recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module that your action needs.

Here is a quick example using webpack:

Taking the previous example `package.json` add `webpack` as a development dependency and add some npm script commands.
```json
{
  "name": "my-action",
  "main": "dist/bundle.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js",
    "deploy": "wsk action update my-action dist/bundle.js --kind nodejs:8"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "left-pad": "1.1.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^3.8.1"
  }
}
```

Create the webpack configuration file `webpack.config.js`.
```javascript
var path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  entry: './index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  target: 'node'
};
```

Set the variable `global.main` to the main function of the action.
From the previous example:
```javascript
function myAction(args) {
    const leftPad = require("left-pad")
    const lines = args.lines || [];
    return { padded: lines.map(l => leftPad(l, 30, ".")) }
}
global.main = myAction;
```

If your function name is `main`, use this syntax instead:
```javascript
global.main = main;
```

To build and deploy an OpenWhisk Action using `npm` and `webpack`:

1. First, install dependencies locally:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

2. Build the webpack bundle:

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

  The file `dist/bundle.js` is created, and is used to deploy as the Action source code.

3. Create the Action using the `npm` script or the CLI.
  Using `npm` script:
  ```
  npm run deploy
  ```

  Using the CLI:
  ```
  wsk action update my-action dist/bundle.js
  ```

Finally, the bundle file that is built by `webpack` doesn't support binary dependencies but rather JavaScript dependencies. So Action invocations will fail if the bundle depends on binary dependencies, because this is not included with the file `bundle.js`.
